## [2.0.0] - 2019-12-09

### Changed
- A breaking change has been introduced in the way URLs are generated. Previously we were calling `encodeURIComponent`
on each part of the requested URL, we are now calling a modified `encodeURIComponent` that excludes some characters to
be compliant with Imgix's official php SDK:
```php
$path = preg_replace_callback("/([^\w\-\/\:@])/", function ($match) {
    return rawurlencode($match[0]);
}, $path);
```

See https://locutus.io/php/url/rawurlencode/ for details
